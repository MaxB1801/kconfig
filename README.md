make linux and .exe compatible

efficient

# workflow
input reqs
loop through
ssh in with username and password or ssh key
retrieve config
save configs in structs
add to struct array
then store in compiled file

# use yaml format

- name: dev
    ip:

    password:



# have two commads
# first command - config will runn config script
# second command - edit-config will open txt edito to edit the config file
# config file - have the dir to save the config
#  and the node ip, uisername, password and cluster name
# delete config before creating
